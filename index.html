            <p>
                Before <i>Hocus Pocus</i> first went into development, there was another Disney movie focused on the
                spooky
                season,
                <i>Halloween House</i>. All that is known is
                that it was meant to be way darker than the finalized movie we got, with the story revolving around
                12-year-old children trapped in a haunted house and needing to escape. In the end, many script and
                management
                changes--such as making the plot more humorous--landed into the <i>Hocus Pocus</i> that went down in
                history. The Sanderson Sisters were finally written in and joined the development process shortly after.
                It is, however, not known if the sisters were intended to be the antagonists in <i>Halloween House</i>.
            </p>
            <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
                <h4 class="alert-heading">Fun Fact</h4>
                <p>
                    Did you know that <i>Hocus Pocus</i> was not released near Halloween? It was released on July 16
                    1993,
                    one
                    month after the release of <i>Jurassic Park</i> (June 11 1993). It's easy to see why a movie fails,
                    when it is up against movies that would become legendary. Because of the larger movie overshadowing
                    Hocus
                    Pocus,
                    it faded into obscurity for a very long time, until the last decade, which leads us to the legacy it
                    holds
                    today.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                For the first movie, the costumes for the sisters were made by Mary Vogt, who previously worked on
                Batman
                Returns from the previous year.
                The popularity of <i>Hocus Pocus</i> and the characters had sparked a sequel many years later, where
                Salvador
                Perez
                remastered
                the
                costumes for 2022. Casted by Leonardo DiCaprio, the sisters were played by Bette Midler (Winnifred),
                Sarah
                Jessica Parker (Sarah), and Kathy Najimy (Mary). </p>
            <p>
                When the sequel began production, the actresses had insisted that if the
                sisters
                were to be brought back, then the people who first played them deserved to return. Disney budged and
                agreed to
                bring them back into the roles, and good thing too. Who knows what would have happened if the sisters
                were
                recasted for someone else?

            <p>
                In the year 1653, thirty nine years before the Salem Witch Trials began, a young Winnefred Sanderson was
                the biggest
                troublemaker Salem
                had ever seen. She refused the word of Reverend Traske to be married to John Prichett, instead wishing
                to marry
                William “Billy” Butcherson. She escapes with her sisters after they are almost taken away. They flee
                into the
                woods, where they meet a mysterious witch who gives them a magic book made by the Devil himself. In it
                lie
                different spells, one that allows them to drain the life force of children to keep them young, one that
                turns
                people into cats, and the most powerful, Magicae Maxima, which could grant them ultimate power. </p>
            <p>Many
                years
                later, during the Salem Witch Trials in 1693, the Sandersons kidnap Emily Binx, to the
                horror of
                Thackery Binx, to steal her life force and become younger and beautiful. Sarah and Mary are pursued by
                Tharkery
                into the woods and to their cottage, where he finds that Winnie has prepared the potion. Despite his
                best
                efforts,
                Thackeray is forced to watch as Emily’s life
                force is drained away. To make him suffer for his failure, the witches transformed Binx into a cat that
                cannot
                die. They would have gotten away with their crime if it wasn't for Binx alerting Elijah, who
                then
                informed the town of the witch's deeds. And so, the saga began.

                witches and
                plan to kill them on the spot. Seconds before execution, Winniefred casts a curse. She states that
                in three hundred years, on All Hallow’s Eve, a virgin would light a Black Flame Candle that would be
                able to bring them back to life. After this happens, the three are hanged, never to be seen
                again for more than three hundred years!

                    The Salem Witch Trials (February 1692 - May 1693) are notorious for scapegoating and false
                    accusations. None of
                    the people executed were real witches. But here, witches were real, and the trials were legitimized.
                    We only
                    see the Sanderson Sisters be executed in the first movie, but it is hinted that many more were
                    killed before
                    them.

            <p>
                <i>Hocus Pocus</i> (B): After a night-long scuffle with Max Dennison, Dani Dennison, Allison Watts, and
                Thackery Binx,
                Winnifred captures Dani and attempts to make her drink the life-taking potion used on Emily. But Max
                steals the
                potion and drinks it himself. He stalls for time long enough for the sun to rise. Even after Winnie
                caught him
                and tried
                to steal his life force, the sun rises and the Black Flame Candle finally burns out. Sarah and Mary
                explode into
                dust, while Winnie is turned into a statue and shatters. With their deaths, the curse they cast on Binx
                is broken, thus ending their terror. But the spellbook survived, making sure that
                the
                sisters would return one day for revenge.

            <p>
                <i>Hocus Pocus 2</i>: Finally accomplishing the Magicae Maxima, the Sanderson Sisters are gifted with
                powers
                they
                could never imagine. But, before this happens, the spellbook, now in the hands of protagonists Cassie,
                Becky,
                and
                Issy, warns
                them that the spell would take away what the user holds most dear. After confronting the sisters of what
                they
                had done, Sarah and Mary slowly fade away, and leave Winnie all alone. Realizing that she had destroyed
                what she
                wanted to protect, she begs the trio to fix everything and bring the sisters back. Cassie recites a
                spell from
                the book that would reunite them. But Sarah and Mary don’t return, instead, Winnie begins to disappear
                as well.
                But she still thanks the girls for their act, and calls for her sisters one last time. With a mighty
                explosion,
                the Sanderson influence over Salem is destroyed, and Billy, brought back by the foolish Gilbert,
                disappears as
                well. Thus, the Sanderson Sisters are gone for good, unless another Black Flame Candle is lit.

            <p>
                <span class="font-weight-bold">Brainwashing</span>: Through song, the sisters were able to hypnotize
                grown men and women to either dance till
                they
                die, or to serve as their dancing henchmen. The two songs that are seen in action during this are "I Put
                A Spell
                On You" and "One Way Or Another."
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="font-weight-bold">Sarah's Song</span>: Sarah is best known for her song that can lure
                children to their cottage so they can
                perform their
                life-draining spells. It promises them to leave their fears behind as they enter a land of fantasy. Of
                course,
                these promises are hallow.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="font-weight-bold">Revivals</span>: Using a Black Flame Candle, the sisters were able to
                transcend death itself. Although, it can
                only
                keep them alive for one night, once the sun rises, lights out. The candle can
                only be lit by a virgin, male or female, and whose effects can be permanent if Magicae Maxima is
                performed.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="font-weight-bold">Levitation</span>: For whatever reason, they can make different objects
                fly, such as broom, vacuums, and
                Rumbas. This was done to explain exactly WHY they could float on brooms, like many stereotypical witches
                do.
                Sometimes they come in use when they are backed into a corner.

            <p>
                <span class="font-weight-bold">Electrokinesis</span>: Winnie starts out as the only one who has this,
                but the Magicae Maxima has allowed the
                other two to gain this power. Whenever Winnie toys with her victims, electricity will be released from
                her fingers. These allow her to simply zap her prey, or cause them to be lifted into the air. This was
                first seen when she had tossed Max around like a ragdool within seconds of them first meeting.

            <p>
                <span class="font-weight-bold">Spellbook</span>: Made by the Devil himself, the sisters' spellbook was
                responsible to giving them the spell
                recipes and their other powers. It appears to be handed down from generations of witches, as the
                sisters
                recieved it at a young age, and later fell into the possession of Cassie, Becky, and Issy by the end of
                the sequel. The book has a setience of its own, and is mostly seen in the sequel, where he is seen
                trying to warn the sisters of Magicae Maxima, sweeting when someone tries to find him on a shelf, and
                crying when the sisters dissapear for good. Winnie cares the most about the book, and claims it to be
                their prized possession, and with all of this accounted for, it's easy to see why.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="font-weight-bold">Magicae Maxima</span>: The Ultimate Spell! Through deception, deals, and
                many tricks, the sisters were able to
                perform
                the legendary spell that could grant the ultimate power to witches and warlocks. The sisters are the
                only known
                witches to ever perform this spell. They would have won if it wasn't for the condition that whatever the
                user
                cares about most disappears. Only then did it give Winnie a reality check and a change of heart.

                And that is the story of the Sanderson Sisters, from their very beginning, all the way to today! Even
